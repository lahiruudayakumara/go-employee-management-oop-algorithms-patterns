# Employee Management - OOP Patterns & Algorithms

## Overview

This repository implements an **Employee Management System** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) patterns** and **algorithms** in **Go**. The system leverages various design patterns and algorithms to manage employee data, including sorting, searching, and organizing employee details efficiently.

The project demonstrates the use of **OOP principles** like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, and integrates algorithms for performance optimization in employee management.

## Features

- **Employee Management**: Manage employee data such as ID, name, salary, department, and more.
- **OOP Patterns**: Implementation of various object-oriented patterns like Factory, Singleton, and others.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, searching, and other common algorithms applied to employee data.
- **Go-based Implementation**: Fully implemented in Go, making it easy to run and scale.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into several key directories:

- **`models/`**: Contains the `Employee` model and its associated methods.
- **`patterns/`**: Implements various design patterns like Factory, Singleton, etc.
- **`algorithms/`**: Includes common algorithms such as sorting (e.g., bubble sort) and searching (e.g., linear search) applied to employee data.
- **`services/`**: Contains services for managing employees and performing operations like adding, updating, and fetching employee data.
